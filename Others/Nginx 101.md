1. What is Nginx?
   Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. It’s widely used for serving static content, handling HTTP requests, and acting as a proxy for backend applications.

```bash
brew services start nginx
```

2. Nginx vs. Apache Tomcat
   Nginx:

- Purpose: Web server, reverse proxy, load balancer
- Protocol Support: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, Websockets
- Performance: event-driven, handles many concurrent connections efficiently
- Use Case: Serving static content, reverse proxying, load balancing

- Acts as a web server (serving static files, handling HTTP requests).
- Can function as a reverse proxy for backend services like Tomcat, Node.js, Python, etc.
- Uses an event-driven architecture that handles thousands of connections with low resource usage.

Apache Tomcat:

- Purpose: Java application server(Servlet/JSP container)
- Protocol Support: HTTP, HTTPS (fpr Java applications)
- Performance: Thread-based, optimized for Java applications
- Use Case: Running Java-based applications (JSP, Servlets, Spring Boot)

- A Java application server designed for Servlets, JSPs, and Java web applications.
- Includes a built-in web server, but it's not as optimized for static content as Nginx.
- Uses a thread-per-request model, which may consume more resources under heavy load.

A common architecture is using Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of Tomcat:

Nginx vs. Apache Tomcat: Key Differences & Use Cases
Nginx and Apache Tomcat serve different purposes, though they can complement each other in some setups. Below is a comparison to help you understand when to use each.

1. Overview
   Feature Nginx Apache Tomcat
   Purpose Web server, reverse proxy, load balancer Java application server (Servlet/JSP container)
   Protocol Support HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, WebSockets HTTP, HTTPS (for Java applications)
   Performance Event-driven, handles many concurrent connections efficiently Thread-based, optimized for Java applications
   Use Case Serving static content, reverse proxying, load balancing Running Java-based applications (JSP, Servlets, Spring Boot)
2. How They Work
   Nginx
   Acts as a web server (serving static files, handling HTTP requests).
   Can function as a reverse proxy for backend services like Tomcat, Node.js, Python, etc.
   Uses an event-driven architecture that handles thousands of connections with low resource usage.
   Apache Tomcat
   A Java application server designed for Servlets, JSPs, and Java web applications.
   Includes a built-in web server, but it's not as optimized for static content as Nginx.
   Uses a thread-per-request model, which may consume more resources under heavy load.
3. Performance & Scalability
   Factor Nginx Apache Tomcat
   Static Content Handling Excellent (optimized caching, low resource usage) Not optimized, better with Nginx in front
   Dynamic Content Handling Requires a backend (like Tomcat, Node.js) Designed for Java-based applications
   Concurrency Event-driven (efficient) Thread-per-request (higher memory usage)
   If you need high-performance static content delivery and proxying, Nginx is better.
   If you are running Java web apps (JSP, Servlets, Spring Boot), Tomcat is required.

4. When to Use Nginx and Tomcat Together
   A common architecture is using Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of Tomcat:
   Why?
   ✔ Improved Performance – Nginx handles static files, Tomcat focuses on Java logic.
   ✔ Security – Nginx can filter bad requests, enforce HTTPS, and limit access.
   ✔ Load Balancing – Nginx can distribute traffic across multiple Tomcat instances.
