3. sudo useradd -d /usr/share/tomcat -r -s /bin/false -g tomcat tomcat

- sudo: Runs the command with superuser (root) privileges
- useradd: Create a new user account on the system.
- -d: Specifies the home directory for the user.
- -r: Tells the system to create a system account.
- -s: Specifies the shell the user will use.
- /bin/false: Sets the userâ€™s shell to /bin/false, which effectively prevents the user from logging in to the system interactively.
- -g: Specifies the primary group for the user.

The command creates a system user named tomcat with the home directory /usr/share/tomcat, no login shell (/bin/false), and with the primary group set to tomcat. This user will typically be used to run the Tomcat server, without interactive login access.

4. getent passwd tomcat

- getent stands for get entries. It is a command-line tool used to query system databases, such as:
  /etc/passwd (user accounts)
  /etc/group (groups)
