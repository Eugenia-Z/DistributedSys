# Example 1: Auto-increment RecordID as Primary Key

## Pros:

1. Uniqueness Guaranteed – The RecordID ensures each row is uniquely identifiable.
2. Simplicity – It is easy to manage and reference in other tables as a foreign key.
3. Efficiency in Indexing – Primary keys based on auto-incremented integers provide efficient indexing and fast lookups.
4. Flexibility – Allows duplicate entries for the same student and problem at different times without issues.

## Cons:

1. No Natural Uniqueness – The RecordID does not inherently represent the data itself, meaning duplicate entries for a student.
2. solving the same problem at the same time would be allowed unless additional constraints are applied.
3. Extra Column Needed – The RecordID is solely for uniqueness and does not contribute to business logic.

## Example 2: Composite Primary Key ([Student, ProblemID, SubmitTime])

## Pros:

1. Enforces Uniqueness on Meaningful Data – Prevents duplicate submissions with the same Student, ProblemID, and SubmitTime.
2. Avoids Extra Column – No need for an artificial RecordID, saving storage space.
3. Better Data Integrity – Ensures no duplicate records exist with the same Student, ProblemID, and SubmitTime.

## Cons:

1. Increased Index Size – Composite keys require more storage and can slow down indexing compared to a single integer key.
2. Foreign Key Complexity – If other tables reference this table, they must include all three fields as a foreign key, making joins more complex.
3. Potential Collisions – If SubmitTime has limited precision (e.g., recorded at the minute level), different submissions within the same minute might be considered duplicates.

# Recommendation

1. If you need a simple and scalable solution, Example 1 (Auto-increment RecordID) is preferred.
2. If you want strict enforcement of unique submissions per student/problem/time and don’t anticipate frequent joins, Example 2 (Composite Key) might be better.
3. For most cases, Example 1 is the better choice unless uniqueness constraints on (Student, ProblemID, SubmitTime) are a critical requirement. You can always add a unique constraint on (Student, ProblemID, SubmitTime) while still using an auto-increment RecordID to get the best of both worlds.
