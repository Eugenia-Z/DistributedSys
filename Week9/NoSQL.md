# NoSQL

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They provide flexibility, scalability, and high performance for specific use cases. There are several types of NoSQL databases:

Document-based: Store data in JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).
Key-Value: Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
Column-family: Organize data in columns rather than rows (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase).
Graph-based: Store data in graph structures with nodes and relationships (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).
